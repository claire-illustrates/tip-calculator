## My process

I started with the challenge as suggested by frontendmentor then redesigned it visually based on the Casio Personal Mini calculator, released around 1975.
I also added some enhancements for accessibility, including adjusting the colour contrast ratio and adding aria-live attributes so that the dynamic changes are announced to screen reader users.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript
- ARIA
